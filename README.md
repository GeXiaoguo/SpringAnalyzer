Spring.Net Configuration Analyzer
==============


SpringAnalyzer analyzes Spring.Net configuration files and gives a comprehensive view of all the object definitions and the inter-relationships between them. This tool is especially useful if you have a large number of configuration files and complicated importing schemes.

It is developed for my personal use for analyzing and restructuring configuration files. No effort is spent on parsing edge or corner cases files. No effort is spent on testing. Bugs are discovered and fixed during use. It works well on all the configuration files that I have. It may as well work on the files you have.

The structure of the code is simple enough that I does not worth specifying. I do welcome new feature extensions and bug fixes.
