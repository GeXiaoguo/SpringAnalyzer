SpringAnalyzer
==============
Spring.Net Configuration Analyzer

SpringAnalyzer analyzes Spring.Net configuration files and gives a comprehensive view of all the object definitions and the inter-relationships between them. This tool is especially useful if you have a lot of config files and complicated importing schemes.

It is developed for my personal use for analyzing and restructuring configuration files. No effort is spent on parsing files that are edge or corner cases. No effort is spent on testing. Bugs are discovered and fixed during use. It already works well on all the config files that I already have. It may as well work on the files you have.

The structure of the code is simple enough that I does not worth specifying. I do welcome new feature extensions and bug fixes.
